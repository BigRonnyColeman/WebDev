        <h3 style="text-align: left; padding-top:3vw; padding-bottom: 1vw;"><b>Free Returns Use Policy</b></h3>
            <p>Free returns are designed to ensure you get an artwork you love, and one that fits your space at home or work. With that in mind Art Dealer will allow a customer to return up to two (2) artworks free of charge, with our company paying the return shipping. Returns above this quantity require written approval from Art Dealer.</p> 
                <br>
            <p>Lay-By orders are subject to different returns policy due to the fact they take an extended time to complete payment. 
               In the event that the artwork from a Layby order is not suitable, Art Dealer reserves the right to void the returns policy with prior notice or allow the return and the buyer may return the artwork in exchange for a gift voucher to the equivalent value of the artwork purchased. 
               The gift voucher cannot be redeemed for cash, it can only be used to purchase an alternative artwork.</p>
                <br><br> 

        <h3 style="text-align: left; padding-top:3vw; padding-bottom: 1vw;"><b>Insurace</b></h3>
            <p>Art Dealer insures all artworks in transit. In the rare case an artwork is damaged in transit, we have it fully covered. You can either be refunded in full, request the artist to create something unique for you or purchase any other piece from our website (store credit) immediately without having to wait for the insurance claim.</p> 
                <br>
            <p>Insurance cases are handled by our professional team and artists are compensated in full as well (if damaged in transit due to courier handling).</p>
                <br>
            <p>If the artworks are returned directly by you, they must be returned via a trackable and insured shipping carrier, and the tracking information must be provided to Art Dealer.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Insurance is valid for the time the artwork is in transit only.</p>
