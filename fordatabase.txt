Susan Trudinger
One of Bluethumb’s most successful landscape artists, Susan Trudinger paints vivid, high-spirited landscapes that emphasise the incredible colours and shapes in the natural world around us. Her abstract approach to various scenes offers a new perspective to traditional settings to the viewer. Her work has been influenced by many years and life experiences, including parenthood, career changes and travelling through the Middle East. It was during these travels Susan found herself “in awe of the landscape, the culture and the fine intricate designs on mosques and other buildings”.

Sally Dunbar
With an impressive array of exhibitions already under her belt, Sally Dunbar has been climbing the ranks in popularity since she first joined Bluethumb in 2017. Sally Dunbar is currently living and working in Canberra and sees art as a sustaining part of her life. Her two-dimensional characters range from Australia’s native animals to classic pet friends at home. Sally’s simplified approach to the canvas provides a sense of candour and ease, much like naïve art so often does.
